# Fundamentals

## Asterisk Architecture
From an architectural standpoint, Asterisk is made up of many different modules. This modularity gives you an almost unlimited amount of flexibility in the design of an Asterisk-based system. As an Asterisk administrator, you have the choice on which modules to load and the configuration of each module. Each module that you load provides different capabilities to the system. For example, one module might allow your Asterisk system to communicate with analog phone lines, while another might add call reporting capabilities. In this section, we'll discuss the overall relationships of some Asterisk component, the various types of modules and their capabilities.

## Asterisk Internal Database

Asterisk comes with a database that is used internally and made available for Asterisk programmers and administrators to use as they see fit.

Asterisk versions up to 1.8 used the Berkeley DB, and in version 10 the project moved to the SQLite3 database. You can read about database migration between those major versions in the section SQLite3 astdb back-end.
